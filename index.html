<br>
<blockquote>
	Newsroom hacks that don't require coding<br><br>
	Learn about some tech tools that can help you conquer common newsroom roadblocks and timesucks. We'll look at how to track websites, gather data like Tweets and FB posts,
	search Google better, sum and subtotal data with Excel, unlock PDFs, make a Google map and more.<br><br>
	This introduction will give you some ideas of what your computer can do for you.<br><br>
	We'll also set aside time at the end for discussion about your news-gathering connundrums.<br><br> 
	Outline: <a href="http://bit.ly/29lcK1b" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/29lcK1b</a><br><br>
	It will be helpful to have: Excel, a Google account (you can make a dummy account if you don't want to link outside services to your own Gmail.)<br><br>

	Problem #1:  "I am all the time checking a website for an agenda or announcement!"<br>
	Solution: Maybe a robot can check it.<br><br>
</span>

<blockquote>

	<li><a href="http//www.changedetection.com" target="_blank">Changedetection.com</a> will email you if a page changes. It checks about once a day, I think.</li> <br><br>

	<li><a href="http://www.ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT.com</a> can check FB, Twitter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a> and other data streams and send you an email, Tweet, etc when it gets something of interest.</li><br><br>


	While I'm standing here, let's do an IFTTT recipe that will send me an email each time there's a USDOJ press release about Georgia:

	Problem #2: "This Google search is giving me too many results."<br>
	Solution: Advanced search can narrow it down in useful ways.
	<br><br>
</span>

<blockquote>
	

	Some of yall probably know about advanced search:<br>
	<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/advanced_search</a><br>
	You can narrow searches by when the site was last updated, by phrases you don't want, etc.<br>
	You can also do it from the search bar, which is nice because you can ask for any filetype, not just the ones listed on the advanced search page:<br><br>

	"tom wolfe" -book<br>
	= search for the exact phrase "tom wolfe," but leave out any results that contain the word "book"<br><br>

	georgia history site:edu<br>
	= search for the words "georgia" and "history", but only in websites that end in ".edu"<br><br>

	landfills site:georgia.gov filetype:xls<br>
	= search for the word "landfills" in all websites that end in georiga.gov, but only show me Excel spreadsheets (.xls)
	TEST3

	(Sometimes the foot of the page will ask if you want to show omitted results. Yes. Show those.)<br><br>

	Problem #3: I've got a data table, but I'm counting up things by hand.  How can I summarize data in Excel?<br>
	Solution: Folks, the Excel Pivot Table.<br><br>
</span>

<blockquote>
	<span class="red">**to insert here: a youtube screen video of me doing this</span><br>
	Let's start with <a href="pix/lotto.xls" download>lotto.xls</a>, a list of where lottery winners live, how much they won and when they won it.<br><br>
	1. Open the file in Excel and find "Pivot Table." In most versions, it's under Data -> Pivot Table<br><br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot1.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot1.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	2. You've clicked "OK" and you are taken to a new page with a black box at the side.<br>
	In that black box, drag "city" down to "row labels"<br>
	Go back up to the top and grab "city" again and drag it down to "values"<br>
	Voila, a count of how many winners come from each city<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot2.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot2.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	3. How about the sum collected by folk in each city?<br>
	In that black box, in the bottom right where it says "count of city," grab that and pull it out of the black box to make it disappear<br>
	Then at the top, grab "amount_won" and pull it down to "Values"<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot3.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot3.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	4. For extra fun, drag "year_won" down to "Row Labels" too<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/pivot4.JPG" target="_blank">

	Problem #4: "This document is a stupid .pdf. It contains tables I want to open in Excel."<br>
	Solution: <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a>.<br><br>
</span>

<blockquote>
	PDFs are kind of like a picture of words and tables. Sometimes you can search the text in a .pdf. But sometimes you can't. And you certainly can't open a .pdf with Excel.<br>
	So there are a couple of services out there that unlock the text and tables in .pdfs.<br>
	It's prone to error because a computer is making its best guess at what it's seeing.<br>
	IMHO, <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a> gives you a really clean conversion at a pretty good price.<br>
	<span class="red">???*** TBC, still free subscription with IRE membership???***</span><BR>
	You can convert a few docs a month with a free subscription<br>
	With a paid subscription, you can do more conversions and "OCR" the text.<br>
	(OCR: Verb. To turn pictures of words into actual searchable text.)<br><br>

	Let's try it with <a href="pix/lotto.pdf">lotto.pdf</a>. And look at the result carefully ;)

	Problem #5: "I want to make a clickable map"<br>
	Solution: There are many ways to do this. I like Google the best.<br><br>
</span>

<blockquote>
	Let's start with a zipped shapefile.  That's just a kind of map.<br>
	Other map formats exist, like KML and KMZ and I don't know what all.<br>
	But Census maps come as shapefiles. And shapefiles can easily be turned into the other formats if you need them.<br>
	You CAN make a Google map from a KML or KMZ, but only a small one, it looks like.<br><br>

	Download a map of Georgia's state Senate districts: <a href="pix/SENATE14-Shape.zip" download>SENATE14-Shape.zip</a><br><br>
	It's got to be converted before Google can open it.<br>
	I use <a href="http://www.shpescape.com" target="_blank">shpescape.com</a>. You're going to have to give it access to your Google account.<br>
	(You can make a dummy Google account if you don't like all these apps in your business!)<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion1.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion1.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	It'll take a minute or two, then you get this.<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion2.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion2.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	That takes you to your Google drive.<br> 
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion3.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion3.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	Whoa!<br>
	This is cool, but let's trim what we see when we click a district. This is TMI.<br><br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion4.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion4.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion5.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion5.JPG" width="300px"><br>

	</a>
	Ah, this is nicer:
	<br><br>	
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion6.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion6.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	OK now embed this in your website:<br>
	Go to tools -> publish<br>
	Change visibility to "public on the web"<br>
	Finally, put this text in "the right place" on your website. "The right place" will vary by how you publish.<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion7.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion7.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	Some newspaper systems, like McClatchy's NewsGate already allow Google map embeds. I would suspect others do too.<br>
	Wordpress requires a plugin. There are many.

	Problem #6: "This file is too large to send/recieve via email."<br>
	Solution: Sign up for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>.<br><br>
</span>
<blockquote>
	This is an app that stores really big files for you. If somebody's email is rejecting a file from you, you can upload it to Dropbox and just send them a link to it.<br><br>

	If they are trying to send you a doc that your email is rejecting, you can send them a link to your Dropbox, and they can send it there without having a Dropbox account.<br><br>

	Problem #7: "I need to download a bunch of documents/pictures from a website. A bunch."<br>
	Solution: Requires Firefox, but try the DownThemAll plugin<br><br>
</span>


<blockquote>
	Please get DownThemAll from the official Mozilla site: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/developers" target="_blank"> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/developers</a><br>
	There are a bunch of weird clones out there I don't want you downloading to your computer.<br>
	It'll walk you through installation
	<br><br>
	Then, let's say we'd like file photos of <a href="http://www.house.ga.gov/mediaServices/en-US/HousePhoto.aspx" target="_blank">all of Georgia's House members</a>.<br><br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/down1.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/down1.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	Gives you this:<br>
	<a href = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/down2.JPG" target="_blank">
  		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/down2.JPG" width="300px"><br>
	</a><br><br>
	And voila.  The pictures start downloading.  Now you have a file photo of everyone in the Georgia House.
