	Problem #1:  "I am all the time checking a website for an agenda or announcement!"<br>
	Solution: Maybe a robot can check it.<br><br>

<h4>

	<li><a href="http//www.changedetection.com" target="_blank">Changedetection.com</a> will email you if a page changes. It checks about once a day, I think.</li> <br><br>

	Problem #2: "This Google search is giving me too many results."<br>
	Solution: Advanced search can narrow it down in useful ways.
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	Some of y'all probably know about advanced search:<br>
	<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/advanced_search</a><br>
	You can narrow searches by when the site was last updated, by phrases you don't want, etc.<br>
	You can also do it from the search bar, which is nice because you can ask for any filetype, not just the ones listed on the advanced search page:<br><br>

	"tom wolfe" -book<br>
	= search for the exact phrase "tom wolfe," but leave out any results that contain the word "book"<br><br>

	georgia history site:edu<br>
	= search for the words "georgia" and "history", but only in websites that end in ".edu"<br><br>

	landfills site:georgia.gov filetype:xls<br>
	= search for the word "landfills" in all websites that end in georiga.gov, but only show me Excel spreadsheets (.xls)
	<br>

	(Sometimes the foot of the page will ask if you want to show omitted results. Yes. Show those.)<br>

	Problem #4: "This document is a stupid PDF. It contains tables I want to open in Excel."<br>
	Solution: <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a>.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	PDFs are kind of like a picture of words and tables. Sometimes you can search the text in a PDF. But sometimes you can't. And you certainly can't open a .pdf with Excel.<br>
	So there are a couple of services out there that unlock the text and tables in PDFs.<br>
	It's prone to error because a computer is making its best guess at what it's seeing.<br>
	IMHO, <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a> gives you a really clean conversion at a pretty good price.<br>
	<span class="red">???*** TBC, still free subscription with IRE membership???***</span><BR>
	You can convert a few docs a month with a free subscription<br>
	With a paid subscription, you can do more conversions and "OCR" the text.<br>
	(OCR: Verb. To turn pictures of words into actual searchable text.)<br><br>

	Let's try it with <a href="pix/lotto.pdf">lotto.pdf</a>. And look at the result carefully ;)

	Problem #5: "This file is too large to send/recieve via email."<br>
	Solution: Sign up for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>.<br><br>

<h4>
<blockquote>
	This is an app that stores really big files for you. If somebody's email is rejecting a file from you, you can upload it to Dropbox and just send them a link to it.<br><br>

	If they are trying to send you a doc that your email is rejecting, you can send them a link to your Dropbox, and they can send it there without having a Dropbox account.<br><br>

	There are a bunch of weird clones out there I don't want you downloading to your computer.<br>
	It'll walk you through installation.

	Problem #7: "I want to make a clickable map"<br>
	Solution: There are many ways to do this. I like Google the best.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	There are may ways to do this.  I'm going to go with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">shapefile (.shp)</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a>.<br><br>
	With these, you can do a big map and customize it in many ways.<br><br>
	Yes there are other ways. And you will commonly see other map formats like .kml and .kmz.<br><br>
	(But FWIW, if you have .kml or .kmz, the map-making process is similar.)<br><br>
	
	Prerequisites: a Google account.<br><br>

	If, like me, you don't want all kinds of outside apps to have access to your Google/Gmail, just make a dummy account to hold maps.<br><br>

	Now, let's download a shapefile of Georgia's state Senate districts: <a href="pix/SENATE14-Shape.zip" download>SENATE14-Shape.zip</a><br><br>

	And we're going to use a website called <a href="http://www.shpescape.com" target="_blank">shpescape.com</a> to push this file into your Google account. Let's get started!<br><br>


<div class="fotorama"  data-allowfullscreen="true">
	<img 
  	src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion1.JPG" 
  	data-caption="1. Go to this website, www.shpescape.com. It will convert the shapefile and put it into your Google account.">
  
  	<img 
  	src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion2.JPG" 
  	data-caption="2. It'll take a minute or two, then you get this. Click the link.">
  
  	<img 
  	src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion3.JPG" 
  	data-caption="3. IF you haven't yet linked to your Google account, it will ask you to do so before you see this screen. Once you're here, click the tab at the top 'Map of geometry.'">

  	<img 
  	src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/fusion4.JPG" 
  	data-caption="4. Whoa! This is cool, but click a district, that's too much info. Let's customize the popup. Click the link that says 'Change info window.'">

  	data-caption="5. Unclick everything except 'district.'">

  	data-caption="7. Now, to get this online, go under Tools, then Publish.">

  	<img

  	data-caption="8. Change visiblity to 'public on the web.' Then that code and paste it in 'the right place' in your website.">

  	<div class="slide">The right place in a website?<br><br>
  		Yep, you have to figure this part out yourself.<br><br>
  		It's pretty standard though. You need the place to put in "embed code" for a Google map, maybe helpdesk can help if it is not obvious.<br><br>
  		If your CMS has an "HTML" tab at the top, try it in there.<br><br>
  		If you're on <b>Wordpress</b>, you'll need a plugin to view an iframe. I use one called "iframe" by webvitaly. There are many though.

I can't do a better walkthrough than Knight Lab has on the <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com" target="_blank">Timeline JS site</a>.<br>
