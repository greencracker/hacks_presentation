	<p>Meet some tools that can help you bypass roadblocks and timesucks on your beat. You'll go back to your newsroom with some ideas about how to track websites, gather data like Tweets, search Google better, sum and subtotal data with Excel and unlock PDFs.</p>
	<p>We'll also look at some ways to get interactive graphics in your online stories, like Google maps, timelines and graphs â€” all without coding.</p>
	<p>That'll be followed by group discussion/Q&A. This is geared toward IT beginners who want an intro to data-gathering and presentation tools.</p>
	<p>Outline: <a href="http://bit.ly/29lcK1b" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/29lcK1b</a></p>
	<p>It will be helpful to have: Excel and a Google account (you can make a dummy account if you don't want to link outside services to your own Gmail.) I'll also demo some free sites that will require a signup if you want to use them, including:</p>

<h2>
	Problem 1:  "I am all the time checking a website for an agenda or announcement!"<br>
	Solution: Maybe a robot can check it.<br><br>
</h2>

<h4>
<blockquote>

	<li><a href="http//www.changedetection.com" target="_blank">Changedetection.com</a> will email you if a page changes. It checks about once a day, I think.</li><br>

	<li><a href="http://www.ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT.com</a> can check Twitter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a>, Reddit and other data streams and send you an email, Tweet, add a line to a Google spreadsheet, etc when it gets something of interest.</li>
	<p>Can robots check other social media like FB, Instagram?</p>
	<p>As far as I know, no publicly-available robot will check <b>other people's</b> traffic on these two. But see Problem 2 for some advanced searches.
	<p>But anyway, while I'm standing here, let's do an IFTTT recipe that will send me an email each time there's a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/justice-news" target="_blank">USDOJ press release</a> about Georgia.</p>
	<p>It's the same as in this video, so you can watch later if you like.</p>

<h2>
	Problem 2: "This Google search is giving me too many results."<br>
	Solution: Advanced search can narrow it down in useful ways.
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Some of y'all probably know about advanced search: 
	<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/advanced_search</a></p>
	<p>You can narrow searches by when the site was last updated, by phrases you don't want, etc.</p>
	<p>You can also do it from the search bar, which is nice because you can ask for any filetype, not just the ones listed on the advanced search page:</p>

	<p><b>"tom wolfe" -book</b></p>
	= search for the exact phrase "tom wolfe," but leave out any results that contain the word "book"<br><br>

	<p><b>georgia history site:edu</b></p>
	= search for the words "georgia" and "history", but only in websites that end in ".edu"<br><br>

	<p><b>Obama AROUND(0) Zuckerberg</b></p>
	= search for "Obama" within 0 words of "Zuckerberg" (ie, right beside it.)<br><br>

	<p><b>Obama AROUND(5) Zuckerberg</b></p>
	= search for "Obama" within 5 words of "Zuckerberg"<br><br>

	<p>Note: AROUND() has to be in all caps. And it doesn't always change the results much. But sometimes it does.</p>

	<p><b>landfills site:georgia.gov filetype:xls</b></p>
	= search for the word "landfills" in all websites that end in georiga.gov, but only show me Excel spreadsheets (.xls)

	<p><b>inurl:pdf "Georgia State University"</b></p>
	= search for the phrase "Georgia State University" in any url that has "pdf" in it.<br>
	("inurl:pdf" will give you pdfs that Google can't find via "filetype:pdf," according to <a href="http://mediashift.org/2015/05/10-expert-search-tips-for-finding-who-where-when/" target="blank">Henk van Ess</a>, to whom I apologize for cribbing some of this stuff. Read him for more fun searches.)<br><br>

	Problem 3: I've got a data table, but I'm counting up things by hand.  How can I summarize data in Excel?<br>
	Solution: Folks, the Excel Pivot Table.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Let's start with <a href="pix/lotto.xls" download>lotto.xls</a>, a (fake) list of where lottery winners live and how much they won.</p>

	<p>It's the same as in this video, so you can watch later if you like.</p>

	Problem 4: "This document is a stupid PDF. It contains tables I want to open in Excel."<br>
	Solution: <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a>.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>PDFs are kind of like a picture of words and tables. Sometimes you can search the text in a PDF & copy it. But sometimes you can't. And you certainly can't open a .pdf with Excel.</p>

	<p>A PDF is like this: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/captcha.JPG">. Text is like this: <b>228</b></p>
	
	<p>So there are a couple of services out there that unlock the text and tables in PDFs.</p>
	
	<p>It's prone to error because a computer is making its best guess at what it's seeing. But IMHO, <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a> gives you a pretty clean conversion.</p>
	<p>You can convert a few docs a month with a free subscription.</p>
	<p>With a paid subscription, you can do more documents. (<a href="http://ire.org" target="_blank">IRE</a> members get a free subscription.)</p>
	<p>Let's try it with <a href="pix/lotto.pdf" download>lotto.pdf</a>. But look at the result carefully ;)</p>

	Problem 5: "This file is too large to send/recieve via email."<br>
	Solution: Sign up for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>.<br><br>
<h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is an app that stores really big files for you. If somebody's email is rejecting a file from you, you can upload it to Dropbox and just send them a link to it.</p>

	<p>If they are trying to send you a doc that your email is rejecting, you can send them a link to your Dropbox, and they can send it there without having a Dropbox account.</p>

	<p>Problem 6: "I need to download a bunch of documents/pictures from a website. A bunch."</p>
	<p>Solution: Requires Firefox, but try the DownThemAll plugin</p>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Please get DownThemAll from the official Mozilla site: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/developers" target="_blank"> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/developers</a></p>
	<p>There are a bunch of weird clones out there I don't want you downloading to your computer.</p>
	<p>It'll walk you through installation.</p>
	<p>Then, let's say I need file photos of all 180 <a href="http://www.house.ga.gov/mediaServices/en-US/HousePhoto.aspx" target="_blank">Georgia state House members</a>.</p>

	Problem 7: "I want to make a clickable map"<br>
	Solution: There are many ways to do this. I like Google the best.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<iframe width="500" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col0+from+1KbM21lxUZrVULagg9x_e9H-c0oqy02_ESaFJcOse+where+col4+%3D+&#39;001&#39;&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=31.112039486145438&amp;lng=-80.4265062890625&amp;t=1&amp;z=6&amp;l=col0&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=KML"></iframe>

	<p>I'm going to go with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">shapefile (.shp)</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a>.</p>
	<p>Shapefiles are good to know about because pretty comprehensive <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html" target="_blank">U.S. Census maps</a> come as shapefiles.</p>
	<p>I like Google Fusion Tables because you can do a big map and customize it in many ways. And Google Maps play well with a lot of news websites and with Wordpress. If you have another map filetype, like .kmz or .kml, the process is similar anyway.</p>
	
	<p>Prerequisites: a Google account.</p>

	<p>If, like me, you don't want all kinds of outside apps to have access to your Google/Gmail, just make a dummy account to hold maps.</p>

	<p>Now, let's download a shapefile of Georgia's state Senate districts: <a href="pix/SENATE14-Shape.zip" download>SENATE14-Shape.zip</a></p>

	<p>And we're going to use a website called <a href="http://www.shpescape.com" target="_blank">shpescape.com</a> to push this file into your Google account. Let's get started!</p>
	<p>Or you can watch this video later.</p>

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38vR3u033gs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>Now you ask, great, how do I add more info to this map, like, say the senator's name? Or party?</p>
	<p>It's a bit long for the scope tonight, but that is exactly what Fusion Tables wer designed for!! Fuse data across multiple sources!  There are <a href="http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/mapping-with-fusion-tables/" target="_blank">tutorials online</a>. You need a spreadsheet in Google that lists every Senator, party and district number. The district number has to match the district number in the Fusion Table exactly. :) Here's a spreadsheet (****COMING SOON ****) you can upload to your Google that will match our Senate map if you want to try mashing them together.</p>

<p>Before we move on, a word about "embed codes." A lot of these web services like Google Maps, YouTube, Plotly, etc, give you an embed code to put in your website. AFAIK, they all start with "&#60 iframe &#62"</p>
<p>These embed codes are pretty common, and I would think most news sites can handle them. You just have to figure out where to put the code.</p>
<p>If your CMS has an "HTML" tab at the top, try it in there.</p>
<p>If you're on <b>Wordpress</b>, you'll need a plugin to view an iframe. I use one called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/" target="_blank">iframe by webvitalii</a>. There are many though.</p>

With Plotly's free tier you can make some simple graphs.<br>
<iframe width="700" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~greencracker/9.embed"></iframe><br>
So first let's prepare some data to give Plotly.<br>
Let's go back to <a href="pix/lotto.xls" download>lotto.xls</a><br>
And make a Pivot Table that sums up winnings by year.<br>
Then we'll put that info in Plotly.<br>

	<p>But before Problem 10, let's talk about limitaions of Google, Plotly, IFTTT, Changedetection and any other outside site you use in publication ...</p>
</h2>
<h4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<p>When you use free services, you're depending on them not to go out of business, for their cloud to not crash, for them to keep the free tier open.</p> 
	<p>If any of these data disasters happen, they take your data with them â€” and your embedded thing will appear as a broken picture. If whoever hosts Timeline JS (Knight?) decides not to do it anymore, it's just gone. Poof, goodbye.</p>
	<p>And as for these graphs, maps and timelines, you don't get a ton of control over how they look, compared to if you were a coder writing someting from scratch.</p>
	<p>These are good quick & dirty tools for day-to-day storytelling.</p>
	<p>But just as FYI, I'm telling you there are some shortcomings.</p>
