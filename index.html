	<p>Meet some tools that can help you bypass roadblocks and timesucks on your beat. You'll go back to your newsroom with some ideas about how to track websites, gather data like Tweets, search Google better, sum and subtotal data with Excel and unlock PDFs.</p>
	<p>We'll also look at some ways to get interactive graphics in your online stories, like Google maps, timelines and graphs â€” all without coding.</p>
	<p>That'll be followed by group discussion/Q&A. This is geared toward IT beginners who want an intro to data-gathering and presentation tools.</p>
	<!--<p>Outline: <a href="http://bit.ly/29lcK1b" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/29lcK1b</a></p>-->
	<p>It will be helpful to have: Excel and a Google account (you can make a dummy account if you don't want to link outside services to your own Gmail.) I'll also demo some free sites that will require a signup if you want to use them, including:</p>

	Problem 1:  "I am all the time checking a website for an agenda or announcement!"<br>
	Solution: Maybe a robot can check it.<br><br>
</h2>

<h4>
<blockquote>

	<li><a href="http://www.changedetection.com" target="_blank">Changedetection.com</a> will email you if a page changes. It checks about once a day, I think.</li><br>

	<li><a href="http://www.ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT.com</a> can check Twitter, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a>, Reddit and other data streams and send you an email, Tweet, add a line to a Google spreadsheet, etc when it gets something of interest.</li>
	<p>Can robots check other social media like FB, Instagram?</p>
	<p>As far as I know, no publicly-available robot will check <b>other people's</b> traffic on these two. But see Problem 2 for some advanced searches.
	<p>But anyway, while I'm standing here, let's do an IFTTT recipe that will send me an email each time there's a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/justice-news" target="_blank">USDOJ press release</a> about Georgia.</p>
	<p>It's the same as in this video, so you can watch later if you like.</p>

<h2>
	Problem 2: "This Google search is giving me too many results."<br>
	Solution: Advanced search can narrow it down in useful ways.
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>Some of y'all probably know about advanced search: 
	<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/advanced_search</a></p>
	<p>You can narrow searches by when the site was last updated, by phrases you don't want, etc.</p>
	<p>You can also do it from the search bar, which is nice because you can ask for any filetype, not just the ones listed on the advanced search page:</p>

	<p><b>"tom wolfe" -book</b></p>
	= search for the exact phrase "tom wolfe," but leave out any results that contain the word "book"<br><br>

	<p><b>georgia history site:edu</b></p>
	= search for the words "georgia" and "history", but only in websites that end in ".edu"<br><br>

	<p><b>Obama AROUND(0) Zuckerberg</b></p>
	= search for "Obama" within 0 words of "Zuckerberg" (ie, right beside it.)<br><br>

	<p><b>Obama AROUND(5) Zuckerberg</b></p>
	= search for "Obama" within 5 words of "Zuckerberg"<br><br>

	<p>Note: AROUND() has to be in all caps. And it doesn't always change the results much. But sometimes it does.</p>

	<p><b>landfills site:georgia.gov filetype:xls</b></p>
	= search for the word "landfills" in all websites that end in georiga.gov, but only show me Excel spreadsheets (.xls)

	<p><b>inurl:pdf "Georgia State University"</b></p>
	= search for the phrase "Georgia State University" in any url that has "pdf" in it.<br>
	("inurl:pdf" will give you pdfs that Google can't find via "filetype:pdf," according to <a href="http://mediashift.org/2015/05/10-expert-search-tips-for-finding-who-where-when/" target="blank">Henk van Ess</a>, to whom I apologize for cribbing some of this stuff. Read him for more fun searches.)<br><br>

	Problem 3: "This document is a stupid PDF. It contains tables I want to open in Excel."<br>
	Solution: <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a>.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>PDFs are kind of like a picture of words and tables. Sometimes you can search the text in a PDF & copy it. But sometimes you can't. And you certainly can't open a .pdf with Excel.</p>

	<p>A PDF is like this: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/captcha.JPG" alt="picture of 228">. Text is like this: <b>228</b></p>
	
	<p>So there are a couple of services out there that unlock the text and tables in PDFs.</p>
	
	<p>It's prone to error because a computer is making its best guess at what it's seeing. But IMHO, <a href="https://www.cometdocs.com" target="_blank">Cometdocs</a> gives you a pretty clean conversion.</p>
	<p>You can convert a few docs a month with a free subscription.</p>
	<p>With a paid subscription, you can do more documents. (<a href="http://ire.org" target="_blank">IRE</a> members get a free subscription.)</p>
	<p>Let's try it with <a href="pix/lotto.pdf" download>lotto.pdf</a>. But look at the result carefully ;)</p>

	Problem 5: "This government agency says my open record request is too big to email."<br>
	Solution: Will they put it in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>?<br><br>

<h4>
<blockquote>
	<p>This is an app that transfers really big files for you, files that are too big to email.</p>
	<p>You set up an account and you send a link to the person who has the big document. That person follows the link to upload the doc to your Dropbox account. Then you download it from there.</p>
	<p>Or, vice versa, you upload a big doc and send somebody else the download link.</p>

<p>Next we're going to talk about how to put things like maps and graphs on your web site.</p>
<p>You probably most all work with a CMS (a "content management system") or WordPress. This is the place where you paste in the text you want to publish.</p>
<p>When you want to publish someting besides words, you have to tell your CMS/WordPress where that map or graph is stored.</p>
<p>For example, if you make a Google map, you need to give your CMS a Google code.  If you make a Plotly graph, you have to give your CMS a Plotly code.</p>
<p>Luckily, these "codes" are standardized and are pretty much a copy-and-paste into your CMS. They're called <b>"embed codes."</b></p>
<p>AFAIK, all "embed codes" begin with "&#60iframe&#62" and are just a couple of lines.</p>
<p>You will have to figure out in your own CMS where to paste the "embed code."  It might be really simple. Here are the buttons for CL & at my version of WordPress, for example: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/cl_button.JPG" alt="cl_button"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greencracker/hacks_presentation/gh-pages/pix/wp_button.JPG" alt="wp_button"></p>
<p>(In WordPress, you *might* need a plugin.  There are many.  I use <a href ="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/iframe" target="_blank">iframe by Webvitalii</a>.)</p>
<p>Your CMS might require a few more steps tho. If you need help, ask help desk where to paste "embed codes."</p>
<p>Anyway, if you make anything online like a Google map, a graph, a timeline or whatever else they've dreamed up, your goal is to get an "embed code" and put it somewhere in your CMS.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>
	Problem 6: "I want to make a graph."<br>
	Solution: Try <a href="http://www.plot.ly" target="blank">Plotly</a><br><br>
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With Plotly's free tier you can make some simple graphs.</p>
<iframe width="700" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~greencracker/9.embed"></iframe><br>
So first let's prepare some data to give Plotly.<br>
Let's go back to <a href="pix/lotto.xls" download>lotto.xls</a><br>
And make a Pivot Table that sums up winnings by year.<br>
Then we'll put that info in Plotly.<br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqLLP7B44Ao" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>There are many sites that do something similar.</p>
<p>If you put a graph on your page, check it on several browsers and PHONES. I've seen reputable news orgs run graphs that are half cut off & unzoomable on phones. I don't know if it's the CMS or the embed or what. But don't be the person who offers mobile users a crummy graph. If one service doesn't work, try another.</p>
<p>You might try <a href="https://infogr.am" target="_blank">Infogram</a>, <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de" target="_blank">Datawrapper</a>, or check <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2506820/business-intelligence/business-intelligence-chart-and-image-gallery-30-free-tools-for-data-visualization-and-analysis.html" target="_blank">Computerworld's list of tools.</a></p>

<h2>
	Problem 7: "I want to make a clickable map."<br>
	Solution: Google Fusion Table maps.<br><br>
</h2>
<h4>
<blockquote>
	<iframe width="500" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col0+from+1KbM21lxUZrVULagg9x_e9H-c0oqy02_ESaFJcOse+where+col4+%3D+&#39;001&#39;&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=31.112039486145438&amp;lng=-80.4265062890625&amp;t=1&amp;z=6&amp;l=col0&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=KML"></iframe>
	
	<p>Let's say you want to make a clickable map of Georgia's congressional districts.</p>
	<p>First you'll need to download a file of that map. Then you'll have to tell Google Fusion Tables to open that map.</p>
	<p>Two really common map formats are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">shapefile (.shp)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language" target="_blank">.kml</a>.</p>
	<p>Shapefiles are big, but you should know about them because sometimes you'll run into them, like on the <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html" target="_blank">U.S. Census website</a>.</p>
	<p>Kmls are smaller and they are the format that Google Fusion Tables wants.</p>
	<p>So let's imagine our source has given us this shapefile of Georgia's congressional districts: <a href="pix/CONGRESS12-SHAPE-2.zip" download>CONGRESS12-SHAPE-2.zip</a>. (If your source gives you a .kml, then you can skip the first step.)</p>
	<p>The first step is to turn this .shp into a .kml. I'm going to use a site called <a href="http://www.mapsdata.co.uk/online-file-converter/" target="_blank">mapsdata</a>. There are others you can also use.</p>
	<p>Let's get started!</p>
	<p>Or you can watch this video later.</p>

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gpzqy6r84FU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>Now you ask, great, how do I add more info to this map, like, say the legislator's name? Or party? Or make the blue districts blue and the red districts red?</p>
	<p>It's a bit long for the scope tonight, but that is exactly what Fusion Tables were designed for!! Fuse data across multiple sources!</p>
	<p>There are <a href="http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/mapping-with-fusion-tables/" target="_blank">tutorials online</a>, but FYI here's roughly what you'll do:</p> 
	<p>First you'll need this spreadsheet, <a href="pix/GA_HOUSE.csv" download>GA_HOUSE.csv</a>. It lists every House member, their party and their district.</p>
	<p>Downlad that spreadsheet and save it in your own Google Drive <b>as a Fusion Table.</b></p>
	<p>Go back to the House map. On the left, go under File -> Merge. Follow the steps merge the two into a new document. Match the two tables by "DISTRICT." Look closely at "DISTRICT."  It's a three-digit number with leading zeroes.  Google can match "001" to "001". But "1" and "001" might confuse it. Your merge column has to match up!</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<p>When you use free services, you're depending on them not to go out of business, for their cloud to not crash, for them to keep the free tier open.</p> 
	<p>If any of these data disasters happen, they take your data with them â€” and your embedded thing will appear as a broken picture.</p>
	<p>And as for these graphs & maps, you don't get a ton of control over how they look compared to if you were a coder writing someting from scratch.</p>
	<p>These are good quick & dirty tools for day-to-day storytelling.</p>
